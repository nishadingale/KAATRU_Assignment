Goal:
Develop a model to find the variables that are significant in the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables and report appropriate metrics of your model evaluation.

Outcome:
The variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes (at least 3). "cnt" is the dependant variable.

variable 1 - "registered" - Correlation Coefficient (0.945411)
variable 2 - "casual"     - Correlation Coefficient (0.672123)
variable 3 - "temp"       - Correlation Coefficient (0.627044)
variable 4 - "season"     - Correlation Coefficient (0.404584)
